This image explains how tasks that need to be triggered **cyclically** (repeatedly at regular intervals) are handled in OSEK using the **alarm object**. Here's a simpler breakdown:

### What is a **Counter**?
- A **counter** is a value that increases over time, often measured in **ticks** (which are just small units of time, like seconds or milliseconds).
- The **counter** keeps track of how much time has passed, and when it reaches a certain value, it can trigger an action (like running a task).

### How OSEK Uses Counters:
- **No direct control**: OSEK does not let you directly manipulate the counter. Instead, the operating system manages it for you.
  
- **Alarm Management**: OSEK automatically manages alarms (triggers) when the counter reaches certain values. The system will decide when to trigger alarms based on the counter’s value and how it is advanced.
  
- **Timer-based**: The counter is tied to either a **hardware timer** (a physical timer in the system) or a **software timer** (managed by the operating system).

### Key Points:
1. The **counter** measures time in "ticks" and is used to trigger alarms (which run tasks cyclically).
2. The OSEK system does not give you direct control over the counter, but it takes care of how alarms are triggered based on the counter.
3. OSEK offers at least one counter derived from either a **hardware timer** or a **software timer** to track time and trigger actions.

### In simple terms:
When you need a task to run repeatedly, OSEK uses **timers** (counters) that increase in small steps (ticks). Once the counter hits a specific value, the system will automatically run the task at that interval. You don’t have to manage the counter yourself—the OS takes care of it!

The sentence "OSEK does not provide a standardized API to manipulate counters directly" means that **OSEK does not give you an API (set of functions) to directly control or modify the counter value**.

In other words, as a user or developer, you **cannot use an API** to:
- **Manually change** the counter value (e.g., increment it or set it to a specific value).
- **Directly manage** how the counter counts or how it is advanced.

Instead, **OSEK** manages the counter automatically for you. The system takes care of:
- Incrementing the counter.
- Advancing it based on the passage of time (using either hardware or software timers).
- Triggering alarms when the counter reaches a certain value.

So, you can **configure alarms**, but you cannot directly control how the counter itself behaves. The OS handles the counter’s operation and ensures that alarms are triggered at the right times based on the counter’s progress. You can only set up alarms to trigger based on the counter's value, but you don't manipulate the counter directly.

You can decide the value when the counter resets, but you cannot directly change or manipulate the counter's value during its normal operation.

### TWO ALARM TYPE

### **1. Relative Alarm** (Timer-Based)
- **How it works**: You set an alarm to trigger **after a specific amount of time** passes.
  - Example: You set an alarm for **5 seconds** from now. After 5 seconds, the alarm goes off.
  - The key here is that the **starting point** is based on **time** from when you set the alarm.
- **Use case**: You might use this when you want an action (like a task) to happen after waiting for a certain amount of time.
  - Example: Start a motor after 10 seconds.

### **2. Absolute Alarm** (Time-Exact Trigger)
- **How it works**: You set an alarm to trigger at **a specific point in time** or **a specific counter value**.
  - Example: You set the alarm to go off when the counter reaches the value **1000 ticks**.
  - The key here is that the alarm goes off **at a specific time or counter value**, no matter when you set it.
- **Use case**: You use this when you need something to happen **at a specific time**.
  - Example: Run a task exactly at 3:00 PM or when the system's counter reaches 1000 ticks.

### **Key Difference**:
- **Relative Alarm**: Goes off **after a set amount of time** from when it’s set (like setting a timer).
- **Absolute Alarm**: Goes off **at a specific time or counter value**, regardless of when it’s set.

### Example to illustrate the difference:
1. **Relative Alarm**: You say, "I want the alarm to go off **5 seconds from now**."
   - If you set it now, it will go off 5 seconds later.

2. **Absolute Alarm**: You say, "I want the alarm to go off **when the system counter hits 1000**."
   - The alarm will go off when the counter reaches 1000 ticks, even if the time it takes to reach that counter is unknown.

I hope this clears up the difference!
