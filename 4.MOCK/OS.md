Your **Headlight Control AUTOSAR OS design** needs careful consideration regarding **task definition, task priority, task type, and event mapping**. Here's how you can structure it:

---

## **1. Task Definition & Task Types**
Each **Runnable** will be mapped to a specific **OS Task**, which is classified into one of these task types:
- **Basic Task (BT)**: Does not block (no waiting), runs to completion.
- **Extended Task (ET)**: Can wait for events, switches to waiting state.

| **Task Name**               | **Task Type** | **Priority** | **Runnables Mapped** |
|----------------------------|--------------|--------------|----------------------|
| `Task_SensorProcessing`     | **Basic Task** | **High (2)** | `ReadSpeedAndSteering()`, `SendSensorData()` |
| `Task_HeadlightInput`       | **Basic Task** | **Medium (3)** | `ReceiveSensorData()`, `ReadAmbientLight()`, `ReadCameraData()` |
| `Task_HeadlightLogic`       | **Extended Task** | **Medium-High (4)** | `ComputeHeadlightLogic()` |
| `Task_HeadlightControl`     | **Extended Task** | **High (2)** | `SendHeadlightCommand()`, `ReceiveHeadlightCommand()`, `ControlHeadlights()` |
| `Task_HeadlightFeedback`    | **Basic Task** | **Low (5)** | `SendHeadlightState()` |

**Priority Considerations:**
- **Lower priority number means higher priority.**
- **Sensor processing and headlight control should be prioritized** since they impact real-time adjustments.
- **Logic computation can be medium priority** but still higher than periodic state reporting.

## **2. Mapping Runnables to Tasks**
Each **Runnable** needs to be mapped to a task in a way that **minimizes context switching and scheduling overhead**.

| **Runnable**               | **Mapped Task**         | **Trigger Condition** |
|----------------------------|------------------------|-----------------------|
| `ReadSpeedAndSteering()`   | `Task_SensorProcessing` | Every 100ms (Timing Event) |
| `SendSensorData()`         | `Task_SensorProcessing` | Runs after `ReadSpeedAndSteering()` |
| `ReceiveSensorData()`      | `Task_HeadlightInput` | On Data Received from `SendSensorData()` |
| `ReadAmbientLight()`       | `Task_HeadlightInput` | Every 100ms (Timing Event) |
| `ReadCameraData()`         | `Task_HeadlightInput` | On New Camera Data Available |
| `ComputeHeadlightLogic()`  | `Task_HeadlightLogic` | On Data Update (ReceiveSensorData, ReadAmbientLight, ReadCameraData) |
| `SendHeadlightCommand()`   | `Task_HeadlightControl` | On Data Update from `ComputeHeadlightLogic()` |
| `ReceiveHeadlightCommand()`| `Task_HeadlightControl` | On Data Received Event |
| `ControlHeadlights()`      | `Task_HeadlightControl` | On New Headlight Command Available |
| `SendHeadlightState()`     | `Task_HeadlightFeedback` | Every 500ms (Timing Event) |

---

## **3. Mapping RTE Events to OS Events**
Since AUTOSAR **OS does not trigger Runnables directly**, we need to **map RTE Events to OS Events**, so the OS schedules the correct tasks.

| **RTE Event**               | **Mapped OS Event**          | **Triggered Task** |
|----------------------------|-----------------------------|--------------------|
| `ReadSpeedAndSteering()` Timing Event  | `Ev_SensorUpdate` | `Task_SensorProcessing` |
| `SendSensorData()` Data Received Event | `Ev_SensorDataSent` | `Task_HeadlightInput` |
| `ReceiveSensorData()` Data Received Event | `Ev_HeadlightInput` | `Task_HeadlightLogic` |
| `ReadAmbientLight()` Timing Event | `Ev_AmbientLightUpdate` | `Task_HeadlightInput` |
| `ReadCameraData()` Data Received Event | `Ev_CameraUpdate` | `Task_HeadlightInput` |
| `ComputeHeadlightLogic()` Data Received Event | `Ev_HeadlightLogicUpdated` | `Task_HeadlightControl` |
| `SendHeadlightCommand()` Data Received Event | `Ev_HeadlightCommandSent` | `Task_HeadlightControl` |
| `ReceiveHeadlightCommand()` Data Received Event | `Ev_HeadlightCommandReceived` | `Task_HeadlightControl` |
| `ControlHeadlights()` Data Received Event | `Ev_HeadlightControlUpdated` | `Task_HeadlightControl` |
| `SendHeadlightState()` Timing Event | `Ev_HeadlightStateUpdate` | `Task_HeadlightFeedback` |

---

## **4. OS Scheduling Strategy**
- **Cyclic Tasks for Periodic Processing (Timing Events)**
  - Example: `Task_SensorProcessing`, `Task_HeadlightInput`
  - These execute at fixed intervals (e.g., every 100ms).
  
- **Event-Driven Tasks for Asynchronous Processing**
  - Example: `Task_HeadlightLogic`, `Task_HeadlightControl`
  - Triggered when new data is available.
  
- **Mixed Scheduling Approach**
  - **Hybrid of cyclic and event-driven** for real-time performance while ensuring efficient CPU usage.

---

## **5. Summary**
1. **Define OS Tasks:** Based on periodic and event-driven execution.
2. **Prioritize Tasks:** Ensure critical tasks run before lower-priority ones.
3. **Map Runnables to OS Tasks:** Group logically related runnables in the same task.
4. **Define OS Events:** Ensure proper synchronization between RTE and OS tasks.
5. **Use Hybrid Scheduling:** Balance periodic execution with event-driven processing.
