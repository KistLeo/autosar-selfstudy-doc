Your **Headlight Control AUTOSAR OS design** needs careful consideration regarding **task definition, task priority, task type, and event mapping**. Here's how you can structure it:

---

## **1. Task Definition & Task Types**
Each **Runnable** will be mapped to a specific **OS Task**, which is classified into one of these task types:
- **Basic Task (BT)**: Does not block (no waiting), runs to completion.
- **Extended Task (ET)**: Can wait for events, switches to waiting state.

| **Task Name**               | **Task Type** | **Priority** | **Runnables Mapped** |
|----------------------------|--------------|--------------|----------------------|
| `Task_SensorProcessing`     | **Basic Task** | **High (2)** | `ReadSpeedAndSteering()`, `SendSensorData()` |
| `Task_HeadlightInput`       | **Basic Task** | **Medium (3)** | `ReceiveSensorData()`, `ReadAmbientLight()`, `ReadCameraData()` |
| `Task_HeadlightLogic`       | **Extended Task** | **Medium-High (4)** | `ComputeHeadlightLogic()` |
| `Task_HeadlightControl`     | **Extended Task** | **High (2)** | `SendHeadlightCommand()`, `ReceiveHeadlightCommand()`, `ControlHeadlights()` |
| `Task_HeadlightFeedback`    | **Basic Task** | **Low (5)** | `SendHeadlightState()` |

**Priority Considerations:**
- **Lower priority number means higher priority.**
- **Sensor processing and headlight control should be prioritized** since they impact real-time adjustments.
- **Logic computation can be medium priority** but still higher than periodic state reporting.

## **2. Mapping Runnables to Tasks**
Each **Runnable** needs to be mapped to a task in a way that **minimizes context switching and scheduling overhead**.

| **Runnable**               | **Mapped Task**         | **Trigger Condition** |
|----------------------------|------------------------|-----------------------|
| `ReadSpeedAndSteering()`   | `Task_SensorProcessing` | Every 100ms (Timing Event) |
| `SendSensorData()`         | `Task_SensorProcessing` | Runs after `ReadSpeedAndSteering()` |
| `ReceiveSensorData()`      | `Task_HeadlightInput` | On Data Received from `SendSensorData()` |
| `ReadAmbientLight()`       | `Task_HeadlightInput` | Every 100ms (Timing Event) |
| `ReadCameraData()`         | `Task_HeadlightInput` | On New Camera Data Available |
| `ComputeHeadlightLogic()`  | `Task_HeadlightLogic` | On Data Update (ReceiveSensorData, ReadAmbientLight, ReadCameraData) |
| `SendHeadlightCommand()`   | `Task_HeadlightControl` | On Data Update from `ComputeHeadlightLogic()` |
| `ReceiveHeadlightCommand()`| `Task_HeadlightControl` | On Data Received Event |
| `ControlHeadlights()`      | `Task_HeadlightControl` | On New Headlight Command Available |
| `SendHeadlightState()`     | `Task_HeadlightFeedback` | Every 500ms (Timing Event) |

---

## **3. Mapping RTE Events to OS Events**
Since AUTOSAR **OS does not trigger Runnables directly**, we need to **map RTE Events to OS Events**, so the OS schedules the correct tasks.

| **RTE Event**               | **Mapped OS Event**          | **Triggered Task** |
|----------------------------|-----------------------------|--------------------|
| `ReadSpeedAndSteering()` Timing Event  | `Ev_SensorUpdate` | `Task_SensorProcessing` |
| `SendSensorData()` Data Received Event | `Ev_SensorDataSent` | `Task_HeadlightInput` |
| `ReceiveSensorData()` Data Received Event | `Ev_HeadlightInput` | `Task_HeadlightLogic` |
| `ReadAmbientLight()` Timing Event | `Ev_AmbientLightUpdate` | `Task_HeadlightInput` |
| `ReadCameraData()` Data Received Event | `Ev_CameraUpdate` | `Task_HeadlightInput` |
| `ComputeHeadlightLogic()` Data Received Event | `Ev_HeadlightLogicUpdated` | `Task_HeadlightControl` |
| `SendHeadlightCommand()` Data Received Event | `Ev_HeadlightCommandSent` | `Task_HeadlightControl` |
| `ReceiveHeadlightCommand()` Data Received Event | `Ev_HeadlightCommandReceived` | `Task_HeadlightControl` |
| `ControlHeadlights()` Data Received Event | `Ev_HeadlightControlUpdated` | `Task_HeadlightControl` |
| `SendHeadlightState()` Timing Event | `Ev_HeadlightStateUpdate` | `Task_HeadlightFeedback` |

---


The **RTE events** in your table trigger the corresponding **tasks** or **runnables** based on certain conditions, and these are mapped to the **OS events** (e.g., `Ev_SensorUpdate`, `Ev_HeadlightLogicUpdated`, etc.) for scheduling in the operating system.

Here’s how the **RTE events** you listed correlate to the **OS events** (from the previous mapping):

---

| **Runnable**                | **Event Type**                         | **Trigger Condition** | **Mapped OS Event**     | **Triggered Task**            |
|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------|-----------------------|------------------------|------------------------------|
| `ReadSpeedAndSteering()`    | **Timing Event**                      | Every **100ms**        | `Ev_SensorUpdate`      | `Task_SensorProcessing`      |
| `SendSensorData()`          | **Data Send Complete Event**          | After `ReadSpeedAndSteering()` | `Ev_SensorDataSent`    | `Task_HeadlightInput`        |
| `ReceiveSensorData()`       | **Data Receive Event**              | New data from `VehicleStateSensor SWC` | `Ev_HeadlightInput`    | `Task_HeadlightLogic`        |
| `ReadAmbientLight()`        | **Timing Event** / **Internal Trigger Event** | Every **100ms** or change in ambient light | `Ev_AmbientLightUpdate`  | `Task_HeadlightInput`        |
| `ReadCameraData()`          | **Data Receive Event**              | Camera ADAS detects object/vehicle | `Ev_CameraUpdate`      | `Task_HeadlightInput`        |
| `ComputeHeadlightLogic()`   | **Data Received Event** / **Mode Switch Event** | Sensor data update or mode switch | `Ev_HeadlightLogicUpdated` | `Task_HeadlightControl`      |
| `SendHeadlightCommand()`    | **Data Write Complete Event**       | After `ComputeHeadlightLogic()` | `Ev_HeadlightCommandSent` | `Task_HeadlightControl`      |
| `ReceiveHeadlightCommand()` | **Data Receive Event**               | New command received | `Ev_HeadlightCommandReceived` | `Task_HeadlightControl`      |
| `ControlHeadlights()`       | **Data Received Event** / **Mode Switch Event** | New command or mode switch | `Ev_HeadlightControlUpdated` | `Task_HeadlightControl`      |
| `SendHeadlightState()`      | **Timing Event**                     | Every **500ms**        | `Ev_HeadlightStateUpdate` | `Task_HeadlightFeedback`     |
| `FailSafeTrigger()`         | **Mode Manager Error Event** / **Data Receive Error Event** | Sensor failure or data error | `Ev_FailSafeTriggered`  | `Task_HeadlightLogic`        |
| `ModeSwitchEvent()`         | **Mode Switch Event**               | Mode switch (e.g., DRL ↔ Low Beam ↔ High Beam) | `Ev_ModeSwitch`         | `Task_HeadlightLogic`        |
| `ModeSwitchAck()`           | **Mode Switch Ack Event**           | Successful mode change | `Ev_ModeSwitchAck`      | `Task_HeadlightLogic`        |

### **Understanding the Relationship**:
1. **RTE Events** are generated by specific **conditions** in the system, like receiving data or a timing event.
2. These **RTE events** trigger **tasks** or **runnables** (e.g., `Task_SensorProcessing`, `Task_HeadlightInput`), which then perform specific actions like reading data, computing logic, or controlling headlight functions.
3. The **OS events** (`Ev_*` prefix) are linked to these **RTE events** and ensure the **OS scheduler** knows when to **trigger the corresponding tasks**.

### Example:

- When the event `Ev_SensorUpdate` is triggered (due to the **100ms timing event**), it activates `Task_SensorProcessing`, which includes the runnable `ReadSpeedAndSteering()`. This way, the OS knows which task to schedule when the event happens.

### **To Summarize**:
- **RTE events** represent **conditions or data** that occur in your system (e.g., "new data received" or "timed event").
- **OS events** (`Ev_*`) represent these RTE events but are used by the **operating system** to trigger and schedule **tasks** (like `Task_SensorProcessing` or `Task_HeadlightControl`).
- The **mapping between RTE events and OS events** ensures proper synchronization and task management in the OS, allowing tasks to run when the right data or conditions are available.

---

In short, **RTE events trigger tasks**, and **OS events are the mechanism** that allows the **OS** to know when to schedule those tasks. This ensures **real-time behavior** and efficient processing in your Adaptive Headlight Control System.



## **4. OS Scheduling Strategy**
- **Cyclic Tasks for Periodic Processing (Timing Events)**
  - Example: `Task_SensorProcessing`, `Task_HeadlightInput`
  - These execute at fixed intervals (e.g., every 100ms).
  
- **Event-Driven Tasks for Asynchronous Processing**
  - Example: `Task_HeadlightLogic`, `Task_HeadlightControl`
  - Triggered when new data is available.
  
- **Mixed Scheduling Approach**
  - **Hybrid of cyclic and event-driven** for real-time performance while ensuring efficient CPU usage.

## **5. Summary**
1. **Define OS Tasks:** Based on periodic and event-driven execution.
2. **Prioritize Tasks:** Ensure critical tasks run before lower-priority ones.
3. **Map Runnables to OS Tasks:** Group logically related runnables in the same task.
4. **Define OS Events:** Ensure proper synchronization between RTE and OS tasks.
5. **Use Hybrid Scheduling:** Balance periodic execution with event-driven processing.
