### **SWC (Software Component) is part of ASW (Application Software) in AUTOSAR.**  

### **Explanation:**  
- **Application Software (ASW)** is the topmost layer in the AUTOSAR architecture.  
- **Software Components (SWCs)** are the building blocks of the ASW layer.  
- Each **SWC encapsulates a specific function** (e.g., sensor processing, motor control, communication).  
- SWCs communicate with each other through **Ports and Interfaces**, but they do not directly interact with hardware.  

### **How SWC fits into ASW?**  
ðŸ“Œ **ASW = Collection of SWCs**  
ðŸ“Œ **SWC = A functional unit inside ASW**  

### **Example:** ðŸš— **Cruise Control System**  
- **Throttle Sensor SWC** (reads throttle position)  
- **Cruise Control SWC** (calculates speed adjustments)  
- **Brake SWC** (disables cruise control when brakes are applied)  

All these SWCs **belong to the ASW layer** and communicate via the **RTE (Runtime Environment)**, which bridges the gap between **ASW and BSW (Basic Software)**.  

### **Summary:**  
âœ… **SWCs** are inside **ASW** and implement application logic.  
âœ… **ASW is independent of hardware**, while **BSW handles hardware interactions**.  
âœ… **RTE connects SWCs** and ensures communication without direct hardware dependency.
