### **Simplified Explanation of AUTOSAR Methodology**  

The AUTOSAR methodology follows **a step-by-step process** to develop automotive software in an **organized** and **structured** way. Here‚Äôs a **simple breakdown** of the key points from your script:

---

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ System-Level Development (Vehicle-Level Planning)**  
- First, we develop all **Software Components (SWCs)** **without worrying about which ECU they will be placed on**.  
- **VFB (Virtual Function Bus)** is used to connect all SWCs virtually.  
  - **VFB is like a big communication network** that lets SWCs talk to each other **without knowing the ECU details**.  
- The system design is done **considering the whole vehicle**.

‚úÖ **Example:**  
Imagine designing **a complete car system** (Engine, Braking, Infotainment, etc.) in software **without assigning them to specific ECUs yet**.

---

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ ECU Mapping (Assigning SWCs to ECUs)**  
- Once system-level development is complete, we **assign each SWC to a specific ECU**.  
- Some SWCs go to **ECU-1**, while others go to **ECU-2**, depending on their functionality.  
- At this stage, **we still consider the overall system, not ECU-specific details**.

‚úÖ **Example:**  
- **ECU-1**: Engine & Speed Control.  
- **ECU-2**: Brake System & Infotainment.  

---

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ ECU Extract (Filtering SWCs for Each ECU)**  
- Since each ECU **only needs some SWCs**, we extract **only the relevant software components** for each ECU.  
- The output of the ECU Extract gives three files:  
  1. **Flatview** ‚Üí Shows **all extracted SWCs** and their connections.  
  2. **Flatmap** ‚Üí Lists **interfaces and components**, mainly for **calibration**.  
  3. **EcuExtract** ‚Üí Contains **ECU signals, mappings, and infrastructure details**.  

‚úÖ **Example:**  
- When running ECU Extract for **ECU-1**, we get only **Engine & Speed Control**.  
- When running ECU Extract for **ECU-2**, we get only **Brake System & Infotainment**.  

---

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ ECU-Specific Configuration**  
- Now, we configure **each ECU separately**:  
  - **OS configurations** (setting up tasks & scheduling).  
  - **Event-to-task mapping** (assigning when tasks should run).  
  - **Assigning SWCs to CPU Cores** (for multi-core ECUs).  

‚úÖ **Example:**  
- If ECU-1 has **two CPU cores**, we can assign **Speed Control to Core 1** and **Engine Control to Core 2**.  

---

### **5Ô∏è‚É£ RTE Generation (Creating the Runtime Environment)**  
- Each ECU needs **its own RTE layer** to handle communication and SWC execution.  
- **RTE Generator Tool** takes all configurations and **creates the RTE code** for each ECU.  
- This process is **repeated for every ECU in the system**.  
- The **RTE uses COM (Communication Stack)** to **handle ECU-to-ECU communication**.

‚úÖ **Example:**  
- Generate **RTE for ECU-1** ‚Üí Provides functions for Engine & Speed Control SWCs.  
- Generate **RTE for ECU-2** ‚Üí Provides functions for Brake & Infotainment SWCs.  

---

### **6Ô∏è‚É£ Final Integration & Testing**  
- Each **ECU runs its own RTE**, and all ECUs communicate via **COM channels** (CAN, LIN, Ethernet, etc.).  
- **Final testing** ensures everything works correctly in the vehicle.

### **üîπ Summary: AUTOSAR Methodology in Simple Words**  

| **Step** | **What Happens?** | **Example** |
|----------|------------------|-------------|
| **1Ô∏è‚É£ System-Level Development** | Design all SWCs and connect them via VFB | Car has Engine, Brake, Infotainment software. |
| **2Ô∏è‚É£ ECU Mapping** | Assign SWCs to specific ECUs | Engine ‚Üí ECU-1, Brakes ‚Üí ECU-2. |
| **3Ô∏è‚É£ ECU Extract** | Extract only relevant SWCs for each ECU | ECU-1 gets only Engine SWCs. |
| **4Ô∏è‚É£ ECU-Specific Configuration** | Configure OS, tasks, CPU cores for ECU | ECU-1 assigns tasks to CPU cores. |
| **5Ô∏è‚É£ RTE Generation** | Generate RTE for each ECU to handle SWCs | ECU-1 & ECU-2 get their own RTE. |
| **6Ô∏è‚É£ Integration & Testing** | Final testing of software and communication | Check CAN/Ethernet messages. |

‚úÖ **Final Thought:**  
- **At the system level, SWCs communicate using VFB.**  
- **At the ECU level, RTE handles real communication.**  
- **Each ECU gets its own RTE, and ECU-to-ECU communication is handled via COM Stack.**
