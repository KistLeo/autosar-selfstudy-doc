### **What is RTE Scheduling (CALC_TASK)?**

In AUTOSAR, **RTE scheduling** refers to how tasks (runnables) within an **SWC** (Software Component) are scheduled and executed by the **RTE** (Runtime Environment) based on their defined timing and triggering events.

**CALC_TASK** is a **task** that runs periodically, typically in systems that require timed actions (like sensors, actuators, or control tasks).

---

### **What Does CALC_TASK Do?**
- **CALC_TASK** is a **runnable task** defined within an SWC. 
- It’s associated with a **timing event** (like every 10ms, 100ms, etc.) or a specific trigger, and it performs calculations or updates data during its execution.

---

### **Where Does CALC_TASK Appear?**
In the **ARXML file**, **CALC_TASK** is typically defined as a **runnable** (a function or task) that is triggered based on time or events.

### **1️⃣ Example in ARXML (Task Definition)**
You define **runnables** in your ARXML under **internal behaviors**. For a periodic task like `CALC_TASK`, you define it along with the event that triggers it (e.g., **timing event**).

#### **ARXML Example: Scheduling CALC_TASK**
```xml
<INTERNAL-BEHAVIORS>
    <SWC-INTERNAL-BEHAVIOR>
        <SHORT-NAME>MyComponentBehavior</SHORT-NAME>
        <RUNNABLES>
            <RUNNABLE-ENTITY>
                <SHORT-NAME>CALC_TASK</SHORT-NAME>
                <CAN-BE-INVOKED>TRUE</CAN-BE-INVOKED>
                <EVENTS>
                    <TIMING-EVENT>
                        <SHORT-NAME>TimerEvent</SHORT-NAME>
                        <PERIOD>100ms</PERIOD>  <!-- CALC_TASK runs every 100ms -->
                    </TIMING-EVENT>
                </EVENTS>
            </RUNNABLE-ENTITY>
        </RUNNABLES>
    </SWC-INTERNAL-BEHAVIOR>
</INTERNAL-BEHAVIORS>
```

**Explanation:**
- **CALC_TASK** is scheduled to run every **100ms** based on the **TIMING-EVENT**.
- The **RTE** will call the `CALC_TASK` function every 100ms.

---

### **2️⃣ Example in C (Runnable Definition)**  
In your C code, you implement the **CALC_TASK** function, which will be triggered by the RTE based on the timing event.

#### **C Code Example: CALC_TASK**
```c
#include "Rte_MyComponent.h"  // Generated RTE header

void CALC_TASK(void) {
    // This is where you perform your task, like a calculation
    int result = someFunctionToCalculateData();
    Rte_Write_OutputData(result);  // Writing the calculated result to an output port
}
```

**Explanation:**
- `CALC_TASK()` is called every 100ms (as defined in ARXML) by the **RTE**.
- This function can perform operations like calculations and then write the results using `Rte_Write`.

---

### **How the RTE Schedules CALC_TASK**
- The **RTE** uses the **timing event** in the ARXML to determine when to trigger the `CALC_TASK`.
- If it's defined with a periodic event (e.g., 100ms), the RTE ensures that the task runs **periodically** at the specified interval.

---

### **When Do You Use CALC_TASK?**
You use **CALC_TASK** for:
1. **Periodic functions** like sensor data processing, motor control, etc.
2. **Tasks that need to run at a regular interval** (like 10ms, 100ms).

---

### **Summary:**
- **CALC_TASK** is a **runnable task** triggered by a **timing event** (e.g., every 100ms).
- You define **timing events** in ARXML, and the **RTE schedules the task** accordingly.
- The task **performs calculations or data updates** in the C code and writes the results through **RTE_Write**.
