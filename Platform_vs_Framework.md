### **Formal Explanation**

#### **Platform**  
A platform is a hardware or software environment in which applications are executed. It provides the necessary infrastructure, including operating systems, hardware, and runtime environments, for software applications to function.

#### **Framework**  
A framework is a pre-built structure consisting of reusable code and components that provide a foundation for developing applications. It enforces design patterns and best practices while offering libraries, APIs, and tools to facilitate development.

| Aspect          | Platform                                     | Framework                                  |
|---------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| **Definition** | An environment where applications run | A structured set of tools and libraries to build applications |
| **Scope**      | Includes OS, hardware, runtime, etc. | Mainly focuses on application development structure |
| **Dependency** | Applications depend on platforms | Frameworks depend on platforms to function |
| **Example**    | Windows, Linux, Android, AWS, JVM | React, Spring, Django, TensorFlow |

### **Easy-to-Understand Explanation**  

Think of a **platform** like a stage in a theater. It provides the foundation where actors (applications) perform. Without the stage, there is no place to act.

A **framework** is like a script and set of props given to the actors. It guides how they should act and interact, making performances more structured and organized.

**Example:**  
- **Platform:** Android (where mobile apps run).  
- **Framework:** React Native (a toolset to help developers build apps for Android).  

In short:  
- **A platform is where things run.**  
- **A framework is how things are built.**
