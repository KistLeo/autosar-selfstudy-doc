Sure! Think of **RTE Events** in AUTOSAR like "alarms" or "triggers" that tell the system when to run certain pieces of code (**runnables**).  

- **Runnables** are small functions inside a software component that perform specific tasks (e.g., reading a sensor, processing data, or controlling an actuator).  
- But these runnables don’t run by themselves. They need something to tell them **when** to run. That’s where **RTE Events** come in.  

### Example in Simple Terms:  
Imagine a smart home system:  
- A **runnable** could be a function that turns on the air conditioner.  
- An **RTE Event** is like a schedule or a button press that tells the system, **“Hey, it's too hot! Run the air conditioner function now.”**  

Different types of RTE Events decide when the runnable should execute:  
1. **Time-based event** → Runs the function every 5 seconds.  
2. **Data received event** → Runs the function when new sensor data arrives.  
3. **Mode switch event** → Runs the function when switching between driving modes in a car.  

The **Operating System (OS)** and **RTE layer** work together to make sure the right function runs at the right time, based on these events.
